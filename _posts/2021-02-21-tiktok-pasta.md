5. Add the spices (Chilli flakes, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper )
6. Put it to bake for **35 minutes**
7. After the 35 mins, increase the temperature to 425F and bake it for another 15 minutes

9. While draining, save some of the pasta water for later
10. Take out the pan from the oven and mix the feta with all the other ingredients
