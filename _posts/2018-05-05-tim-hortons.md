Our Canadian coffee.

The one and only Tim Hortons. It's what people feel comfortable with, it's where they go when they are running late to a meeting and are in desperate need of coffee. I am a coffee maniac, but truly a Tim Hortons maniac. I mean I can't write about every Tim Horton's I've been to, because there would be too many to list here. Tim Horton's is my go to place. I don't have to think twice about getting coffee from here. These are my favorite orders; medium coffee (2 milk, 1 sugar), iced coffee (less ice), iced cappuccino( less cream, so you taste the coffee more). Their potato wedges are great, however I do miss the one time they had their kettle baked chips. Sour cream glazed donuts is something that you can have and savor for the whole day. Tim Hortons has advanced over the couple of years, especially when Burger King took over August 2014. Now, there are coffee shops where you go to get fancy coffee, casual dates, or even just sit alone and ponder things in life. Tim Horton's gives you coffee, one thing you go to a coffee shop for. I can't really complain or compliment Tim Horton's. They keep their coffee fresh all the time, whether it is every 20 minutes or 15. I guarantee the coffee from Tim Hortons has its warmth, heat and taste of caffeine.

**History of Tim Hortons**

Believe it or not, they started in **Hamilton**, not even Toronto! They started in 1964 by a Canadian hockey player Tim Horton and Jim Charade. How come Tim used his name as the coffee place? How would it sound if Tim Hortons became Jim Charade. Imagine...I'm going to grab a coffee from Jim Charade...Jim who?... Jimmy, the coffee shop the Canada runs on. I guess Tim Hortons has a better ring to it than Jim (no offense). Then I started reading more and more. Tim Hortons (Miles Gilbert), a NHL player, top 100, wanted to started burger chains initially. The store started off as Tim Horton Donuts, and if you ever want to visit the original store: 65 Ottawa Street, Hamilton, ON. The place is still there! Finally, there is one great attraction in Hamilton (BenGiggles) I guess Jim was never in the picture, because Tim's main partner was a police constable Ron Joyce. He helped Tim Hortons grow and expand to nine countries and travel across Canada. That's enough history for now. I love fun facts, and I guess the fact is here is that "Timmies" started in Hamilton and it is still open for business!


PICTURES WILL BE COMING SOON!
