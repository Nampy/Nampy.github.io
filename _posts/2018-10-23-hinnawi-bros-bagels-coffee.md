When my brother moved to Montreal, we set some certain traditions. Both of us love coffee and love love to try new places!

It was a Saturday morning and I was walking over to my brothers place with coupons for A&W breakfast. As a university student, you really learn the importance of looking out for coupons and see which places have good food, quantity and the best price. Now going back to my walk, it was raining that day but not **pouring** which I was pretty happy about. I got half way to my brother's place, I couldn't really walk anymore, I didn't have an umbrella and forgot to wear my bright green coat. I took shelter near a Second Cup Shop and called my brother. I told him we could meet halfway since I already knew it was better that way. We met, and arrived at A&W, the breakfast is great there, nothing wrong with it. Beside A&W, we spot Hinnawi, look at each other and come to a conclusion. There was nothing much to think about and we walked inside! On one side of the coffee place there are couches for casual sitting, and the other has tables and chairs with random (for me) paintings on the wall. We sat down, and we looked at the menu that was written on the wall in chalk…pretty creative! Obviously both of us got a coffee and a latte, and bagels as well. The thing about ordering bagels is that you get chips on the side with it. Whether it is morning, afternoon or night time…there are **CHIPS**! If you don't know me, I am a huge chips fan…I can binge on them bags at a time. The coffees weren't the best, maybe for a reason that I have no clue. However their bagels were amazing…did not need to add anything more, everything that needed to be in a bagel was there. Both of us were so full as we left the place, that's one thing for sure. This is a great place to sit and relax and also if you love bagels and chips! It is a pretty creative idea to create both breakfast and lunch bagels at the same place. All the **bagels** are named under certain cities. If you are ever in Montreal and want to try something new, go out and try their bagels and chips, worth the experience.
