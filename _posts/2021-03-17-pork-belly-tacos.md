Let's start by gathering all the ingredients. I like to "organize" my kitchen a little bit before I jump into cooking. Most of the time it doesn't go according to plan but at least, YOU KNOW that you had a plan and steps to execute it. First, I'm going to do a breakdown of what I've done and I will try to do that from now and on for the rest of my recipes, especially the more complicated ones.

- Cooking pork belly
- Preparing taco toppings
- Making modified guacamole
- Optional: Rice

</ul>

Extra >> 1/2 cup basmati rice

1. First thing first, let's get the pork belly cooking in a pot.

2. Chop up the onion, tomato and ginger. Place it in the instant pot (or pressure cooker of your choice), and add a cup of water.

3. Place the pork belly fat side facing up and add all the spices (or your choice of taco seasoning).

4. Turn it on high and pressure cook for 30 minutes and let it release naturally.

5. While the pork belly is cooking, let's prepare the toppings.

6. Thinly slice red onion (save half a handful of onion for guacamole) and emerge it in vinegar with a hint of water and 1 teaspoon of maple syrup.

7. Thinly slice the shallots and chop the green pepper. Sautee them in oil and season them with salt and pepper.

8. Thinly slice jalapeno in round circles.

9. Finely chop coriander. Cut the onion and tomato in a cube shape and mix with the coriander. Lightly season them with salt and pepper.

10. The sour cream you can use as is, but I add hints of lemon juice and mix it...this tastes really good!!

11. Cut the pineapples in to a semicircle shape

    > I grilled my pineapple in some homemade taco seasoning but with less chili powder

12. Now the pork belly should be ready! Take out the pork belly and let it cool. DO NOT drain the water.

13. Using the same pot or another pot: Put the 1/2 cup basmati rice and use 1 cup of pork belly liquid in a pot and set the heat high. Once it boils, turn it down to low, cover the pot (~8-10 minutes)

14. By this time, the pork belly must be cooled down. Cut the pork belly in rectangular shapes. Grill them on a pan so the fat side is crispy.

    > I would use this pan to grill my pineapples to get a taste of the pork belly

15. We are almost there!

16. Making this modified guacamole is simple:
    1. Chop up the avocados.
    2. Add the left over red onion.
    3. Add salt and pepper and mix all together.
17. Now have fun assembling your taco, stuff it with as many toppings as you want. This is your taco and there is no limit to what you can have inside of it... The only question is whether you'll be able to fold it!
