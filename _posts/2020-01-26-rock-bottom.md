Is there even such a thing as rock bottom? Personally, I dont believe anyone can truly hit rock bottom in their lives. For sure, people all have low points in their lives, but theyre never truly at the lowest possible point. But our situations seem so terrible in the moment that we feel as though things couldnt get any worse. Thats why we call it our rock bottom. The thing about hitting the bottom though is that there is only one way to go Up! I always say to myself and others that its not just about hitting rock bottom, but rather the path that led you there and how you plan on getting back to the top. My parents always told me to reflect on my actions, words that had no meaning to me at the time. I never understood why it was so important to reflect until I started doing it.

Reflection offers the opportunity to connect with oneself and as an individual helps us to realize what went wrong. The road to the top is much easier traveled if you figure out what the problem was at the beginning. Take me for example. I failed math quizzes in university - not once, not twice, and definitely way more than three times. Gee, in that moment things couldnt have been worse for me. This was my rock bottom at that time. No matter how much I studied or what I was doing, it wasnt helping. But my course of action was not to give up or be hard on myself; there was no time for that. Instead, I thought about What was I really doing wrong?. I knew I was studying, I knew I was doing the problems, so what else could it be? Well, after much reflection I realized that the thing about math problems is that no matter how many problems you do, if you dont truly understand the meaning of an equation, then youre just memorizing instead of learning something new. I was working extremely hard to pass this course, but just not in the right ways. I had figured it out - I was trying to understand each math problem individually, and how to get the solution. Instead, I needed to look at each chapter and understand why and how things worked. I needed to do more problems and look at the solutions at the end and not right away. For each problem I did, I needed to make sure I knew why I did it the way I did.

Now that I knew my problem, it was time for me to journey back to the top. And in the end, I did just that and passed that math course with flying colors. It might be a procedure to get back up, but you must try regardless of how much time it takes. First things first, quickly get up off the ground, brush the dirt off, and realize what the initial problem was. After that, take your time getting to the top. If youve gotten up off the ground, one way or another youll make it to the top, far away from your rock bottom. Just plan your course of action and path to getting there based on the problem you identified.

Hitting rock bottom does not mean the world is against you. Its not the end, no time for tears, no time to jump to conclusions you dont control. Learn to get back up right away and gather all the strength you have. Dont give up on yourself. When it comes to you, always try your best and give it all you got. Youll reach the top eventually.

See you there.

Yours truly,
Moon
