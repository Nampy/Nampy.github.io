> Craving a Japanese cheesecake, but still on a keto diet...I feel you!

###### `Ingredients`
<ul>
<input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 6 Eggs (separated)
<br>
<input type="checkbox"  class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 16oz Cream Cheese
<br>
<input type="checkbox"  class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 3/4 cup Keto Sugar (Swerve/Monkfruit)
<br>
<input type="checkbox"  class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 2 tbsp Lemon Juice
<br>
<input type="checkbox"  class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
<br>
<input type="checkbox"  class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 1 cup Almond Flour
<br>
<input type="checkbox"  class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 1 tsp Baking Powder
<br>
<input type="checkbox"  class="task-list-item-checkbox"> 1 tbsp Butter
</ul>

> *I used a 8 inch diameter pan and had extra batter to make 2 mini cheesecakes. If you have a 9 inch or 10 inch it would be better.*

1. Bring the eggs and cream cheese to room temperature.
2. Separate the egg whites and yolks.
3. Starting with the egg whites: beat the eggs until it forms fluffy peaks. It should look like clouds and feel really soft. Put it aside.
4. Beat the egg yolks for 2 minutes. Add cream cheese in 2 parts. Each time, make sure you beat until smooth and creamy.
5. Take a break from beating to get your baking pan ready.
   1. Cut a circle shaped piece of parchment paper for the pan.
   2. Spread butter on the bottom of the pan so that the parchment paper sticks.
   3. Line parchment paper along the sides as well. To help it stick use butter!
6. Now, back to the egg yolks: Add lemon juice and vanilla extract and beat for 2 minutes.
7. Add keto sugar in parts while beating. Make sure the batter is still smooth and creamy.
8. Next, add almond flour and baking powder in parts and beat constantly. Make sure the consistency remains the same.
9. Once you are sure that the batter is **smooth and creamy**, preheat the oven to 320F. 
10. Time to fold in the egg whites to the batter (1/3 at a time). 
    1. If the egg whites are watery at the bottom, do not add that. Just grab only the fluffy egg white parts.
    2. If you have watched my macaron video, I show you how to fold and check if it is the right consistency.
    3. When folding, do not over work and make sure you are always using the same patterns to fold.
11. To prevent cheesecake from cracking, just like in the article I followed I baked the cheesecake in a water bath.

    1. Wrap your pan tightly with aluminum foil.
    2. Place the baking pan on top of a baking tray.
    3. Fill the tray with enough water so that you are able to lift it and place it in the oven.
12. Bake for 80 minutes. Do not open the oven in between as the heat will escape and your cake will deflate.
    
    1. Check with a skewer if it is cooked.
13. Open the oven door slightly and let the cheesecake cool for 30 minutes.
14. Get your fork and start eating!!

> Eat the cheesecake either hot or even the next day after refrigerating it.
