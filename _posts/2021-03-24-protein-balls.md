####  `Preparing the Lentils`

> Tip: Soak the lentils for a few hours beforehand - they come out softer and easier to mix

1. Heat up the pressure cook and add 1/2 tbsp oil.
2. Once oil is hot, add the chilli powder,  roasted cumin, and salt.

3. Add lentils and 1.5 cups of water. Stir, close the lid, and turn the heat up to high.
4. After 1 whistle, turn the heat down to medium.
5. Wait 10 minutes and then turn the heat off. Let the pressure naturally release.

#### `Preparing the Beans`

1. In an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, saute the onions and add salt.

2. Add the pinto beans and water (enough to cover the beans).

3. Pressure cook for 20 minutes, and let the pressure naturally release.
4. Once done, drain the water, reserving around 2 cups for later use.

#### `Heat the Plant Based Meat`

1. Using a frying pan, heat the plant based meat and separate it.

5. Form snack sized balls to your liking and place them on parchment paper. I was able to make 23 protein balls.

6. Place the balls in the oven for 30 minutes, then remove and let cool.

There you have it!  Enjoy with a sauce of your choosing - I love hummus or tahini. Whether for your lunch or just a mid-day snack, it has never been easier (or tastier) to get some protein in.
