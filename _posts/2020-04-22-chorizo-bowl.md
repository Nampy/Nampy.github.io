Cooking is so much easier when you have all the ingredients given to you in a bag! The prep and cooking only took me 20 minutes. During these times, it was a fun experience for me to wander outside my comfort zone, strictly follow a recipe and cook by the book. And then, I went back to something I'm all too familiar with: eating and enjoying the food. I was very pleased with the final dish, and I hope everyone gets to try cooking from a meal kit at some point. It will be a fun adventure, guaranteed!
