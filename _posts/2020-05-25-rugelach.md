##### I referenced the book: "The Mixer Bible" for the base of the dough. In the book, the recipe was for 6 dozen cookies, but I scaled it down to about 1 - 1.5 dozen cookies.

The ingredients and recipe below are for 12-18 cookies. I have made it into a checklist, so that you can check these off as you are at a grocery or even looking through the fridge and pantry for them. 

###### `Cookie Dough`
- [ ] 2/3 cup cream cheese (room temperature)
- [ ]  1/3 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)
- [ ]  3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour
- [ ]  pinch of salt
{: style='list-style-type: none'}

###### `Savory Filling`

- [ ]  1 cup tomato sauce (pasta sauce)
- [ ]  2 cloves garlic (minced)
- [ ]  2 handfuls of coriander (finely chopped)
- [ ]  2 slices bacon (chopped)
- [ ]  1 tsp olive oil
- [ ]  Jalapeño (finely chopped)
{: style='list-style-type: none'}

> **Helpful Tip**: The more filling you have, the better... You can eat the extra on the side!

#### **Prepare the dough**

<img src="/assets/images/rugelach/second.gif" style="zoom:80%;" /><center><em>Attach flat beater. Set to speed 4 and beat until smooth.</em>

<img src="/assets/images/rugelach/third.gif" style="zoom:80%;" /><center><em>Reduce speed to stir mode. Slowly add flour and salt as it is stirring. Mix in stir mode until dough comes together.</em>

<img src="/assets/images/rugelach/fourth.gif" style="zoom:80%;" /><center><em>Separate the dough into two disks. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for 1 hour until dough is fairly firm.</em>

#### **Prepare the Filling**

<img src="/assets/images/rugelach/fifth.gif" style="zoom:80%;" /><center><em>Bring pan to medium heat and add 1 tsp of oil. Add garlic and let it cook until golden brown. Add jalapeño and bacon. After 2 minutes of stirring, add a handful of coriander. Once the coriander begins to turn a darker green, slowly add the tomato sauce. Stir for 5 minutes. Add the rest of the coriander and turn heat to low. After 5 minutes, turn off the heat.</em>

#### **Put everything together**

> After the dough has sat for an hour, **preheat the oven to 375°F.**

<img src="/assets/images/rugelach/sixth.gif" style="zoom:80%;" /><center><em>In your work area, sprinkle confectioner's sugar around. Work with one disk at a time, and keep the other refrigerated. Roll the dough out and attempt to make a circle shape. Thinly spread the filling around.</em>

<img src="/assets/images/rugelach/time_to_bake.jpg" style="zoom: 25%;" /><center><em>Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown.</em>

> **Helpful Tip:** I checked them halfway through and flipped so the baking was even on both sides.
