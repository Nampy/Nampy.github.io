Amazing experience at Au Pied de Cochon for their annual Cabane Ã  Sucre. I would definitely like to try their menu every year if I get the reservations on time. The only things I did not enjoy were the desserts (except the Mille-feuille), since they all tasted too much like raisin.

Thank you for this amazing music.
