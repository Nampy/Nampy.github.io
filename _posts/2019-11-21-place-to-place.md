I have moved from one place to another for the majority of my life. Ive never really learned how to settle down in one place. Basically, I have lived out of my suitcase for a long time  but trust me, its not as bad it sounds. There were times when I stayed put longer than usual. For example, the time I moved to **Markham** in grade five, to our new house. I unpacked, got my room ready, and lived there for a whole seven years maybe even more. Is finding a place to settle down really necessary? Is it so bad that you like to move around and find things to do all over the place?   

When I was younger, moving around wasnt that big of a deal for me, since I never really knew what was going on. But as I got older, it was not so easy moving around from place to place. It took a lot of courage and strength to keep myself together as I started new chapters in my life.  

I was born in India and lived there for 5 to 6 years, after which I moved to Canada. Yes, it was a big change for me, but being a child there was a lot of excitement in me, an adventurous feeling. I knew I would always be able to visit my family in India and that they would always be there. My first few years in Canada I would move every year, so that was the norm for me. My kid brain got used to the moving and was always prepared. When I moved to Markham though, I finally settled for longer than usual. Woah! My body was not used to this and had no idea what to expect. How much longer would I be here?  

From an early age, my parents taught me that friends are to be cherished and that some friends get so close that they are basically family. And they werent kidding! I made friends in Markham that are like family to me. We have formed so many unforgettable memories. We grew up together, went through high school initiation together, and then spent our time in high school together. Darn, we went through a lot of our milestones together as well. These were some great memories and moments of our lives. I think it was the hardest for me to leave Markham right before my senior year. This was another whole family that I didnt want to leave behind. I didnt want to leave at all. I knew it was going to be hard, but just like India, I knew this wasnt a goodbye. Its never a goodbye to your family - they will always be there.  

After seven years in Markham, **New York** was next. Older and wiser, moving to New York was a bigger change for me, and my brother as well. This move was hard, but I am more than happy that my dad and brother were there. I was afraid to go to high school in this new place, but what kept me together was the strength and support I got from my family. It was and still is this imaginary shield they have on me that no matter what will always be there to help and protect me. In the end, I got through senior year and thrived by once again making new friends and family here in New York. We had classes together, we planned university together, and as usual made memories together. However, I knew I wasnt going to be here for long, and as it turns out my next adventure was back in Canada, specifically the city of **Montréal**.

This time it was university, and it was nothing like high school. I was living in residence, which was amazing, but that is besides the point. The first day my family dropped me off, I cant really say what I felt. They were leaving me; they were going to drive four hours away from me. First night living at my residence was terrifying. I am not going to lie; I was excited but that first day I was also scared. I chatted with my Markham friends and to be honest, they were all feeling the same. Really, if I had to guess, almost all the first years were feeling the same that day. But, we all made it to university and it was going to be one big ride! And the next four years were definitely that, and more! Ill leave that story for another blog, but suffice it to say that I didnt want to leave Montréal. More than the education, the friends and people I met here were great. They were yet another family with whom I formed so many wonderful memories. Many stories to tell for generations. I made bonds you cant break with people, and relationships that will last a lifetime. I didnt want to graduate because that meant Id have to move on to my next adventure. As much I was excited for that, I was also anxious to let go of what I had called home the past couple of years.  

But now was the moment for me to start my career. This move I knew no one where I was going. Brand new place, brand new people. It wasnt like university where everyone was starting new at the same time. There are times when I was in **Ottawa** and I had no idea what to do. If you know me though, you know I dont spend a lot of time dwelling. I gave myself a few hours in Ottawa to settle in, then started adventuring to see everything the city had to offer. Over time, I made friends, got close to many and started making memories with them. I am not sure where and when my next adventure will be, but I am loving Ottawa and more the family that I have here. I am truly blessed to be here and still have all my families in India, Markham, New York, and Montréal.   

Simply put, it is difficult moving places, especially at the beginning. However, it is always a new adventure. As a result of constantly moving around, Ive learned the importance of keeping friendships that last a lifetime. People assume that when youre not wanting to settle down, it means that youre too afraid to get close to people, or some psychoanalysis that I dont understand. For me its simple: I like travelling, meeting new people, making new friendships, learning new things and trying various jobs in a field I love. This does not mean that I am keen on losing the ties Ive already made. On the contrary, I love keeping them!

To all the friends Ive made over the years, Ive had amazing memories with you, and they will always be with me. They mean a lot to me, even little things you may have forgotten by now. But I hope you remember it all and one day we can meet up in the middle of the world, have a drink and laugh about all the moments we shared. Youre never forgotten, always remembered, always in my heart.  

And to all the friends I havent met yet: I cant wait to see you in my next chapter!  

Yours truly, 

Friend
