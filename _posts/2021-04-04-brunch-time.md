> Brunch *(noun)*: A late morning meal eaten instead of breakfast and lunch

Above definition is false...

Brunch is more than just food. See it this way, when we eat breakfast it takes us maybe 5 minutes to eat then we head to work or get on with our days. Now for brunch, food is there in front of us. We can eat, but we eat it so much slower. There's a lot of food in front of us too and we are not forced to finish it in 5 minutes. For example, the brunch I had once was yes a lot of food. We ate for around 20 minutes, but we didn't get up. We talked and talked and now an hour as passed. Then we started eating a little more. We still didn't get up. We talked and talked, and now half of the food was gone and the conversations kept going. What I'm trying to say is that brunch is not just about food. Brunch is food that brings people together to catch up and socialize. You can easily spend 3 hours with friends with brunch food, laughter and talks. During University times, brunch was amazing! Most of the time, it means you had a really good Friday night out (REALLY FUN) and you wake up around 10AM then starting texting your friends..."brunch time?" That's all we had to ask and then the common replies would be.."same place, ready in 5?" or "Give me 30 to get up and where?". To future University students, this is why Friday is the best night to go out and have fun, because Saturday is late brunch, chill and chill. Then Sunday you have time to catch up on other stuff. I'll save that for another blog post. Anyways back to brunch! Brunch homemade makes the cooking enjoyable too. Either way, for brunch all you need is good food and good company then everything else follows with it.

You can be creative as you want for your type of brunch. It can range from a variety of fruits to a variety of meat. For me I had a mix of both and I kind of planned in my head how we would eat it...It felt like I was orchestrating how we should eat and when and what should be eaten next. It felt natural to me and if people followed that way naturally then I succeeded.

For here, my goal was people would be drawn to the eggs, then they see the bagel, avocado and then the tomatoes. Instantly, they want to put together a modified avocado toast to start their brunch talks. Slowly eating that they see the prosciutto, but now they are confused between doing another bagel prosciutto avocado toast or take a break and have some waffles. So now they decide to have a few waffles with some maple syrup poured on their plate. After revealing more of the platter, they start seeing the potato wedges, and sausages. They've had enough sweet for now and want to eat a sausage and get ready to plate another avocado toast but this time with some prosciutto. Obviously in between we are taking breaks, and talking plenty. We are so full but we haven't tried everything on the plate yet.

This is brunch so the eating has to continue. We're slowing down to eat but because we want the conversations to keep going we need to nibble on something. Here comes the baked beans and potato wedges. We can have conversations and snack on these while talking. We are at a point we don't really want to leave the table. We got to digest these. Oh boy! Greek yogurt and fruits...When you get here, you know you've lost track of time and the conversation is amazing and you're not gonna let it end. You're going to pull through and keep eating. Enjoy the sugar of the fruits and the tanginess of the oranges. Voila you're finally done the platter. Now you look up at the time and "How did the time pass by, oh shoot!" You don't DARE to look at the time while you're eating or having good conversations. This is the power of a brunch. It is not breakfast, it's brunch!
