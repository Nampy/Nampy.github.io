My brother moved to Montreal this year. Which means I am there to celebrate his birthday with him. Where else to start your brother's birthday than a cafe with great interior and an amazing menu! Twas my brother's birthday, and we decided to try a new coffee shop. As we walked into the coffee shop, we notice plants hanging, a nook you find in houses. This cafe gave a sense of home to us. Maybe it was the fact that my brother and I were going to a cafe together, but there was every thing. Across from where I was sitting, you notice a man typing rapidly trying to finish a last minute assignment. A lot of things were happening in the cafe, but the thing that caught my eye the most was the nook where we were sitting. The white painting and the green plants complemented the place so well. There was no specific art work on the latte, which I was a bit disappointed at because sometimes that's what I look forward to when getting that latte. Yes, it can destroy the artwork when we start drinking it, however seeing the artwork sets the tone and relaxes us. It lets us reflect and enjoy the tiny moments that we have! This Cafe is different over all, brings many views and cultures to it.
