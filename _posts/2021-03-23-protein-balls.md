###  Preparing the lentils

> Tip: Have the lentils soaked the day off, it turn out softer and easier to mi

1. Heat up the pressure cook and add 1/2 tbsp oil. Add 1/2 tbsp of chilli powder and roasted cumin, and salt (more if you'd like).

2. Add lentils and 1.5 cups of water. After 1 whistle, put it on medium wait 10 minutes and then turn the heat off. Let it naturally release.

### Preparing the beans

1. In an instant pot or presure cooker, saute the, add salt.

3. Once done, drain the water but keep it aside for later use.

### Heat the plant based meat

1. Using a frying pan, heat the plant based meat and separate it.

4. Now the lentils. At any point if it is too dry, add some of the saved up water from the refried beans. This helps it to mix well.
