Everybody is familiar with the term “inner circle”, having heard it or used it at least once in their lives. But here’s an interesting thought: why is it a circle and not any other shape? I have a theory on this, but first we need to understand what an inner circle is. For me, an inner circle will always be there when I need them, and they will be there for me unconditionally. Rain or shine, day or night, I can call them up and ask for help, or share my joy, or even my sorrows. No matter how badly I’ve messed up and no matter how long it has been, I can go to them and rest easy knowing I won’t be judged or shamed. In happiness or sadness, they will always be there; my support system. So, this group is like a circle in two big ways. Firstly, their existence and support are **endless** in that wherever and whenever I turn, I will find them right there beside me ready and waiting. Secondly, just as a circle is a smooth and round shape with no sharp edges that can hurt you, this group can also **never hurt you**. No matter what I say to them, they’ll never respond negatively, and will cherish and love me as they always have.

So, does everybody have an inner circle? Personally, I think everyone has at least one person who meets my definition of an inner circle; it’s just a matter of realizing that you have people like that in your life who are there for you. It’s important to note that an inner circle doesn’t have to be just specific people you know like your friends. For some, God is an excellent example of someone who will be there for you always and unconditionally. For others, they feel comfortable reaching out to helpline services with their problems and concerns. My inner circle consists of my family and friends (if you are reading this, you know who you are) whom I talk to daily. OK… I’ll admit, sometimes on a not so daily basis (my bad)... But that’s exactly what I mean by saying that they’re there for me unconditionally! For example, take my mom and dad. They are my number ones. When it comes to them, there is no shortage of love and support for me. I can count on them to correct my mistakes, guide me, and catch me when I fall. Although it may feel like I’m being constantly judged and corrected, after a while I realize that such pushing and nagging is exactly what I need. In the end, whatever I do, meeting them halfway or not, they will still be there for me.  These are the type of people I would hope everyone has in their inner circle. I’d be willing to bet that everyone out there has somebody in their life like this, but maybe they just haven’t met yet.

Alright, so what about the inverse? Are we all part of somebody’s inner circle? Just because somebody is part of our circle doesn’t mean that they see us the same way. This isn’t Facebook where we can simply add somebody to our inner circle just because they added us to theirs! But trust me when I say this: there’s no reason to feel unloved or unwanted if you’re not mutually part of someone’s circle. You’re definitely part of SOME circle, and whether you know it or not, you are having a huge impact on that person’s life by simply being yourself.

At times, I imagine what it would feel like if my inner circle was broken and no longer a circle. Where would I go? Would I be lost without them? Hopefully this just stays as another one of my crazy thoughts! For everyone out there who knows who their inner circle is, be grateful and thankful for them, as you are truly blessed to have people like that in your lives. And for everyone else who doesn’t know who is in their inner circle: there are people out there for you – you just don’t know it yet.

Love,

Circle
