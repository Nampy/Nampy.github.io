Before COVID-19 began, I had a few projects that I wanted to start and one of them being my little herb garden. I had some material from my last apartment laying around. For example I had a piece of wood that didn't fit anywhere, so I decided to use it for the garden. These are the materials that you need to create a mini garden like mine.

- wood
- [mason jars](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/golden-harvest-mason-jars-500-ml-12-pk-0422509p.html#srp)
- [steel strapping](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/dahl-all-round-steel-pipe-strapping-0633641p.html#srp)
- nails and drills
- soil
- [herb seeds](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/mckenzie-herb-seeds-0598133p.html#srp)

Most of the things can be found at home if you browse through enough. It was a neat project and simple one as well. Putting together the garden only took me 1 hour. Comment below if you have any questions or are planning to try this out!
