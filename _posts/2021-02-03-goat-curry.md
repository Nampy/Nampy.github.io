###### `Ingredients`

- [ ] 1kg of goat (I get mine in pre cut stew pieces)
- [ ] 6 onions (diced)
- [ ] 2 tbsp oil
- [ ] 3 tomatoes (diced)
- [ ] coriander leaves (finely chopped)
- [ ] 1 can tomato paste (156 mL)
{: style='list-style-type: none'}
###### `Spices`

- [ ] 1 tsp cumin seeds
- [ ] 2 tbsp coriander 
- [ ] 1 tsp turmeric
- [ ] 2 tsp chili powder
- [ ] 3 tbsp [meat masala](https://www.shanfoods.com/product/recipe-mixes/curry/meat-masala/) 
- [ ] 2 tsp salt
- [ ] 1 tsp ginger paste
- [ ] 1 tsp garlic paste
- [ ] 1 tsp garam masala 
{: style='list-style-type: none'}

>  **Tip:** Take out the meat from the freezer and place it in the fridge a day ahead

#### **Prepare the Ingredients**

Preparing the ingredients can be done in any order, make sure these are completed before starting the next step

- Dice the onions

- Dice the tomatoes and place it in a colander so the water can drain 

  > **Tip:** Save the tomato water to be used when making rice (gives the rice a bit a flavor)

- Wash the goat with a bit of vinegar and place it in another colander to let the water drain

#### **Get Cooking**

> **Tip:** Have the prepared ingredients near by along with all the spices

Using Instant Pot to cook (Cooking with one pot means easy clean up after!!!)

1. Set the Instant Pot to the Sauté (high) setting

2. Add oil and let it warm up

3. Once the oil is hot enough, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle

4. Add garlic and ginger paste, and let it cook for a minute

5. Add all the diced onions and stir constantly to avoid burning

6. Once the onions are starting to look yellow/golden, add the goat meat, and stir

7. Add the tomatoes and the tomato paste

   > **Tip:** Swirl some hot water around the can to get all of the paste

8. Add the spices (coriander, turmeric, chili powder, meat masala, salt)

9. Stir until everything is well mixed

10. Put the lid on and set it to high pressure for 30 minutes

11. Once complete, let the pressure release naturally and remove the lid

12. If you want a thicker curry, put it on sauté mode and stir

13. Add garam masala and keep STIRRING!

14. FINAL STEP: Add coriander leaves to garnish, last 2 stirs and get ready to serve!!!

##### `Serve with basmati rice or naan or porotta. The options are endless`


> **Tip:** Goat has a lot of fat, so to reduce the amount of fat, try this. After cooking, let it cool, and place in the fridge. Next day, a layer of fat will be produced on top of the meal (yellowish orange color). Scrape that off and reheat the food and enjoy!
