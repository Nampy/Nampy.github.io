These are some of my favorite quotes of all times, there may be a huge list, however these made it to the top! The quotes below have probably shaped me in a certain way..."They are very me." All of these quotes are incredibly descriptive of the way I live. 

***

**"Keep moving forward."** -- *Walt Disney*

The quote can be taken into different perspectives. Off topic now, do you know the movie: "Meet the Robinsons"? This is one of my favorite movies, the underlying theme and quote is Walt Disney about keep moving forward. Recommended to watch for all ages. Back to topic, Walt Disney did not just stop at one of his inventions, if he ever did, I doubt he would have got anywhere with anything. 

Things happen to us all the time, we're humans! Bad things happen to us, but pick up that leg, and step forward. At times it can seem as if our legs are glued to the ground and we are stuck in a position  regardless if we want to be there. What you need at times such as this, is not to accept defeat, find ways to get out of it and move forward. The only direction is, to go forward. Keep moving forward, doesn't hurt to stop looking ahead!

**"Be the change you wish to see."** -- *Mahatma Gandhi*

The fundamental, you want change, change yourself. Simple as it can be, right? (#BenGiggles) Let me give you a mini personal experience. When I was young, my brother and I played together all the time. He followed me around, and I did too. I was his best friend, he listened to me all the time, best younger brother ever! As years passed, our "teen" years I guess, things changed. This is when he was eleven or twelve. I was so upset he wouldn't listen to me, or just follow me around. I was upset he changed, I wanted him to change back (#typicalSister). I am two years older than him, and then and there I came to a realization. What if I'm the one who changed or needs to change? I can't just push my younger brother around anymore! If I want to see change, I need to change, it was pretty simple. That's how I did it. I mean I was only 14 then, those are my teen years. Another thing, be the change you wish to see...at home, in the world, at work, anywhere. This can be applied anywhere. It starts with you!

**"Why fit in when you were born to stand out?"** -- *Dr.Seuss*

My all time favorite Dr.Seuss really did it when he said this! You're different, you're an amazing individual who brings out something new to this world. You don't need to fit in, because you are an extraordinary human being. You're the shining star. This quote speaks for itself, there is no need for an actual explanation. It actually took me sometime to find a font that actually makes sense for this quote. (#BenGiggles)

**"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."** -- *Mahatma Gandhi*

These are top three quotes, yes I kind of swayed a bit since I slid in one more quote at the end for you. In the end these are just sayings, words, quotes that people once stated a long or not so long time ago. They are words you as an individual can pursue, follow, or practice! What are your top quotes? How do these quotes impact you? Do they define or shape how you live?
