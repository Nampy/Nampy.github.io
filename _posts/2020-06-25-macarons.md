Everyone was always talking about how macarons are delicious but difficult to make, and since I love them so much I just had to give it a go. I started looking through other videos and recipes getting hints and help. The following links really helped me and I've also posted some helpful tips that might help you in the future. The most nerve-racking part was when I placed the macarons in the oven, and I just sat on the kitchen floor, waiting for them to rise. I would turn my camera on and off, just in case the macarons were too camera-shy to rise, but in the end everything worked out.

The ingredients and recipe below are for 30 macarons, but I was able to make around 68 to 70 mini macarons. I have made the list into a checklist, so that you can check the ingredients off as you are at a grocery or even looking through the fridge and pantry for them.

###### `Macarons`

- [ ] 1 ¾ cups powdered sugar

- [ ] 1 cup almond flour

- [ ] 1/2 tsp salt

- [ ] pinch of cream of tartar

- [ ] 3 egg whites, room temp (30 mins sitting out)

- [ ] ¼ cup granulated sugar

- [ ] ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

- [ ] Food coloring

###### `Cheesecake Filling`

- [ ] 8 oz of cream cheese

- [ ] 1 cup powdered sugar

- [ ] 1/4 cup graham crumbs

  {: style='list-style-type: none'}

*Other common fillings:* vanilla buttercream

> **Helpful Tip**: Make the filling when the first batch works, and the feet are seen on the macarons
