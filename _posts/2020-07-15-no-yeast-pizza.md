##### I referenced the book: "The Mixer Bible" for the base of the dough and then made modifications regarding the yeast. This recipe will make 2 medium sized pizza doughs.

The ingredients and recipe below are for 2 pizza doughs. I have made it into a checklist, so that you can check these off as you are at the grocery or even looking through the fridge and pantry for them. 

------

At the beginning of the quarantine, it was so difficult for me to find yeast and flour. Eventually, I got lucky and found pizza flour, but yeast was nowhere to be found! After doing some research on why yeast is even necessary and how it works, it was pretty easy to figure out substitutions and try to make it work.

`Yeast helps leaven bread and provide an airy, light texture. Active dry yeast must be dissolved in water before using and left to set and "activate" before usage.`

I needed something that would make my dough rise, just a bit at least. Baking soda is a leavening agent. It helps the dough rise, but needs an acid to activate it. The substitution calls for equal parts lemon juice and baking soda. For example if you need 2 tsp. yeast, then you use 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp. lemon juice. Unlike yeast, the dough will begin rising right away, and doesn't need the typical proofing time. That being said, let's get to the recipe and the making of pizza!

###### `Pizza Dough`

- [ ] 3.5g baking soda
- [ ] 3.5g lemon juice
- [ ] 1 tbsp virgin oil
- [ ] 3 1⁄3 all purpose flour
- [ ] 1 tbsp salt
  {: style='list-style-type: none'}

###### Pizza Toppings

- [ ] 1 cup tomato sauce (pasta sauce works in a pinch)
- [ ] 2 slices bacon (chopped)
- [ ] 1 tsp olive oil
- [ ] 1 onion (chopped)
- [ ] 1 packet mushrooms
- [ ] Jalapeño peppers (finely chopped)
  {: style='list-style-type: none'}

> **Helpful Tip**: Prepare the ingredients while the dough is set aside.

<script>$(document).ready(function(){$('.task-list-item-checkbox').prop("disabled", false);});</script>

#### **Chopping the toppings**

> After the dough has sat for 45 minutes to an hour, **preheat the oven to 375°F.**
>
> While that's happening, let's get to chopping.
