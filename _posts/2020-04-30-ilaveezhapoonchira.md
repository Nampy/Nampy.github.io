A look back at all the pictures I took on an adventure with my cousins to ***Ilaveezhapoonchira***. This long word means "the pond of flowers where the leaves do not fall". My cousin told us that if we got to the top we could see this mysterious pond of flowers, so we set off... It was a hike!
First it started off windy, then it became misty, and finally it started hailing down! We just kept walking trying to get to the top, but the farther we went, the harder it rained. It was getting difficult to keep up with everyone and the path was starting to get very slippery, so we decided to end the trek with a hot cup of black tea/coffee and try again another time.
