Since I have been working on controlling my sugar intake by a bit, I have also tried trying out new ways I can substitute my sugar cravings. This is super easy and you can make it within 45 mins and that's including the baking and rest time.  This keto website really has some good recipes and I got the avocado recipe from [here](https://www.ruled.me/keto-avocado-brownies/). I made minor changes like replacing the butter for coconut oil and adding less sugar than it asked. I also used peanut butter instead of almond butter. 

The ingredients and recipe below are for a loaf of brownies. I have made the list into a checklist, so that you can check the ingredients off as you are at a grocery or even looking through the fridge and pantry for them.

###### `Ingredients`

- [ ] 2 large eggs

- [ ] 1 avocado (biggest one you can get)

- [ ] 4 tbsp coconut oil

- [ ] 4 tbsp peanut butter (all natural)

- [ ] ½ tsp baking soda

- [ ] ¼ tsp salt

- [ ] 1/3 cup erythritol/stevia blend (find at bulk barn or at amazon)

- [ ] 1/3 cup cocoa powder

  {: style='list-style-type: none'}

###### Steps

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Mix all the ingredients together in a food processor 
3. Pulse for about 45 seconds. If you over mix the brownies will have more of a cake texture to them.
4. Transfer the batter to the pan (lay parchment paper or aluminum foil) 
5. Bake for about 25 to 30 mins 
6. Cool for 10 to 15 mins 
7. ENJOY!!!
