The month of December, it brings joy in many forms. Kids count down days to unwrap gifts and enjoy being home away from school. Parents or just adults, wait to get off work to be with family and loved ones. There are traditions for families that take place. Everyone manages during the holidays.

![](/assets/images/days-of-giving/Robo.PNG.png){:width="50%" align="left"} The few days that are left in December, I am hosting a a drive for toys and gently used winter wear for the less fortunate. The toys will be donated to the Children's Hospital (CHEO). These drives will be hosted in Ottawa. 

Donate at the nearest kids hospital near you!

Updates will be posted here and on the [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/benspirationA3K/) page.
