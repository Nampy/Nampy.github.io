Starbucks, where to begin. How or when did I even start to know about this place? Honestly, it was my sister's obsession to coffee and Starbucks that got me even thinking about getting something from here. Before I start my story, I will cut to the chase and say my all time favorite are the frappuccinos. Well number one for now!

So let's see, Starbucks. There are so many stereotypes for this place (#BenGiggles). The next few lines in this post is very opinionated...so it will be about my experience and what I truly think of this place.

Starbucks is a branded coffee place. You have a legit a brand on the type of coffee you drink. We are branding the product so when you buy from Starbucks, an average person would be seen completely different! In my personal experience, the coffee from Starbucks is bitter and dark and strong. It is amazing, is true coffee, tastes great! If you are a true coffee drinker then usually there is no milk or sugar added. However, for me, I need my sugar and milk most of the time. Since the coffee is pretty dark and bitter, the amount of sugar I add is tremendous (more as a sugar drink).

 All of the Starbucks I have been to are notable for studying purposes or simply put, to do work. I go to Starbucks, I feel more important than ever, order a cup of coffee and start typing away.

 

I would really recommend the *green tea frappuccino* with no whip cream and no extra sugar added who are a bit health conscious. Whether you are health conscious or not, the coffee cakes are mouth watering! Every single bite of this treat makes you crave for more. When you get to the end of the cake, you wonder how you ate it so quickly. Finally, you are stuck thinking whether you should get another one or not! Of course, we decide to get one more and run out of the coffee shop, holding on to the cake tightly! Their spinach and feta cheese wrap is exceptional! That is a must to try as well.

 

Starbucks is not for everyone. You get styles here that you won't get anywhere else. The Teavana drinks are only served from Starbucks. They are different and cools you down during the summer heat. My go to would be *Mango Black Tea Lemonade*. I always get my tea with low sugar and low ice. The only reason I get it low ice is so that I can enjoy the drink for a longer time than just drinking water half way though.

Have you ever wondered about the logo? How it started? Where this whole thing started! I found out about Starbucks and the logo, a couple of years back. There is an evolution to this logo. In **1971**, the logo was a twin-tailed mermaid, which was used to "lure" coffee lovers from all around the world. It went through a dramatic change in **2011**, when they celebrated their 40 year anniversary! In this new logo, you can still see the twin-tails and clearly it is a mermaid who is luring you to drink her coffee. Enjoy the coffee from Starbucks.
