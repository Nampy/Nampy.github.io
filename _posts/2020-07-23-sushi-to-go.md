During this quarantine, I wasn't able to visit AYCE sushi restaurants, and I was starting to crave it. I got the ingredients and thought I would make a quick video of it. After this, I realized I could eat A LOT of sushi!!  

This same thought had gone around to my friends and then we started wondering, if we can have pizza making parties, why can't we have sushi making parties? I guess this will become a Friday night special once in a while now... WATCH OUT GUYS!  

Special shout out to Ikson again for his awesome tunes. Check it out in the link below.
