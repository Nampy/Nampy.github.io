Once I got Hello Fresh, I needed to try the other competitors as well - after all it's only fair! Chef's Plate was a good experience. There were a variety of recipes to choose from and the premium ones were available at an additional price. I got 3 different recipes which came out to 6 full meals. The only thing I had a problem with was the quality of the ingredients. They weren't as fresh as I thought they'd be, or they didn't stay fresh for that long. However, I was able to salvage most of the ingredients to cook all of the meals as intended. This video is not sponsored by Chef's Plate. If you guys do want to give it a try, use my [referral link]( https://www.chefsplate.com/?r=3pc-uyzEe6W), and it will give you 4 free meals.
