<center>"Beginning is just another fancy word for a do over."</center>

There are lot of things that we may consider beginnings. A sunrise is a beginning for mother nature to tell us, she is waking up. A beginning for a child could be when they first immerse from a mother's womb, or when they start to walk. Beginnings have many stages, many forms, and many parts! In a day, you can have at least 10 beginnings of various things. Beginnings can be big or small, they all matter. For me, every time I move to a new place, it is a new beginning! From Kerala to Toronto to Markham to New York to Montreal and now Ottawa. Those are great beginnings. Who knows where my next beginning will be? People often say with every beginning, comes an end to something else. I mean yes with an sunrise, it means our night ends and so on. Let's look at it another way...Not all beginnings are an end to the previous beginnings. Its almost as if you're putting a pause and will resume some other time, just not right away. Appreciate beginnings.Beginnings are a way to see the challenges you take every day. They tell a story. Every story has a beginning, but not every story has an ending. Start something new today! See the adventures and challenges you face. One beginning can lead to various ways of telling ONE story. How I saw beginnings were these gifts I'm unwrapping and see what surprise is waiting for me at the end of the unraveling. They're exciting, if you have a beginning, you get to write the story however way you want to . You have the pen, you're the typist, let that beginning unfold the creative mind of yours. Let the stories be told in ways you never knew it could be said. My new beginning today was me starting to write my blogs, what will your new beginning be?
